                <p>Started with Quarto, moved to raw HTML/CSS yesterday. Added a lot of images, text, and audio today. It started with the apple alien yesterday. I just added other images like the series at the bottom of the main page. I added the Gdoc link the bottom as the guestbook.</p>
                <p>I made some text and images draggable so it can be interacted with as well. The image series also has links for each one for some context. Filling up this writing page just for blog writing writing of it is the last thing I'll do. It's 12:00am midnight and I'm tired. Might push. Bye.</p>
